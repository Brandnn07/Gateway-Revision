      <h2>What is Andorra?</h2>
      Andorra is a micronation (6th smallest in Europe and 16th in the world) located inbetween France and Spain home to roughly 77 thousand people. It is believed to have been created by Charlemagne, former Holy Roman Emperor by way of Charter in 1278. The primary language is Catalan, a derivitive of Latin spoken by Romans, however many languages are spoken on a daily basis such as French, Spanish and even English! The capital city Andorra La Vella is located in the Pyrenees mountain range and is the highest capital in Europe! It boasts beautiful scenery and lovely wildlife where *most* are harmless.

      <h2>Why Andorra?</h2>
      Though small in size, Andorra is rich with culture, music/concerts, food etc. due to the variety of people living there, most being of Catalan descent. The food is a mixture of dishes from ALL around the world to create some of the most unique and delicious platters you will ever taste! We have dishes such as the Trucha a la Andorrana, which is a Trout from local rivers wrapped in Ham, and Coca Massegada, which is a dessert that consists of a flat oval sweet bread topped with candied dried fruits and almonds. It is also a host of ski resorts and concerts from popular artist like world famous DJ Martin Garrix.

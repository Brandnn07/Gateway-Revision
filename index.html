          <h2>What is Andorra?</h2>
          <p>
            Andorra is a micronation (6th smallest in Europe and 16th in the
            world) located inbetween France and Spain home to roughly 77
            thousand people. It is believed to have been created by Charlemagne,
            former Holy Roman Emperor by way of Charter in 1278. The primary
            language is Catalan, a derivitive of Latin spoken by Romans, however
            many languages are spoken on a daily basis such as French, Spanish
            and even English! The capital city Andorra La Vella is located in
            the Pyrenees mountain range and is the highest capital in Europe! It
            boasts beautiful scenery and lovely wildlife where *most* are
            harmless.
          </p>
          <h2>Why Andorra?</h2>
          <p>
            Though small in size, Andorra is rich with culture, music/concerts,
            food etc. due to the variety of people living there, most being of
            Catalan descent. The food is a mixture of dishes from ALL around the
            world to create some of the most unique and delicious platters you
            will ever taste! We have dishes such as the Trucha a la Andorrana,
            which is a Trout from local rivers wrapped in Ham, and Coca
            Massegada, which is a dessert that consists of a flat oval sweet
            bread topped with candied dried fruits and almonds. It is also a
            host of ski resorts and concerts from popular artist like world
            famous DJ Martin Garrix.

          <p class="asideContent">
            Andorra is the worlds ONLY co-principality! A principality is a place ruled by a prince. Monaco is an example of
            a principality. Andorra, however, is a co-principality. They have
            two princes who jointly share the title of prince. Surprisingly,
            neither of the two princes are from Andorra. One prince is the
            President of France, Emmanuel Macron. The other co-prince is the
            Bishop of Urgell, who is currently Joan Enric Vives Sic√≠lia. The
            position is a constitutional one similar to the British Monarchy and
            holds no real power. Except for limited things, the two princes must
            exercise their authority together, not separately. This is the only
            country where one of their heads of state (the President of France)
            is democratically elected by another country. The other prince, the
            bishop, is appointed by the head of state of another country (the
            Pope).
